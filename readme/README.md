Problem Statement - Contextual Chat Bot:

Mandatory Requirements:
Simple Contextual Chat Bot Document Parsing: Read and process a long PDF/Word document.

Contextual Chatbot:
Answer questions using the document, responding with "I don't know the answer" if no relevant answer is found.

Simple Interface: Provide a basic interface for document upload and querying.
Performance Evaluation: Propose a method to evaluate model performance in production.
FastAPI Integration: Develop a REST API with endpoints for document upload and querying using FastAPI.
MLOps Pipeline: Propose an end-to-end MLOps pipeline using draw.io, including model versioning, monitoring, and retraining.

Documentation: Include a README with setup instructions.

Advanced Challenge (Bonus Points):
Open Source LLMs: Use an open-source LLM instead of OpenAI (e.g., GPT-Neo, LLAMA).
Document Chunking: Split the document into chunks and store in a vector database (e.g., Milvus).
Semantic Search: Retrieve top 3 relevant chunks using semantic similarity search.
Performance Evaluation: Implement a method to evaluate chatbot performance (e.g., accuracy). Share the report as well
Pipeline management: Propose a method to create and manage data pipelines assuming you bring above use cases to production and have to inference it by sharing a document
